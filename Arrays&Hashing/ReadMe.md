# Arrays & Hashing

These quesitons are about List and Strings

**Common solution:**
1. Use dictionary to store elements like their counts for future comparment. Use dictionary keys smartly and creatively. 
2. Instead of thinking specific rules for single element, thinking about rules that could be applied for going through the entire data set. (e.g. #128)
3. Use dynamic programming instead of computing values from the very beginning each time (e.g. #238)
