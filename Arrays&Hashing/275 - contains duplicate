# Thoughts:
# Compared to get the solution after all the computation, sometimes the result is already obvious in the middle
# (e.g. there is a duplicate value in the middle of the list)
# Therefore, the problem could also be solved by for loop and get the conclusion when there exists an example against the rule.
